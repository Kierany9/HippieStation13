# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.

changes: 
  - tweak: "Fire extinguishers now fire 10u instead of 5, and carry 100u instead of 50 so that they're less awful at extinguishing."
  - tweak: "Fire extinguishers now use VAPOR instead of TOUCH. This means that reagents inside the extinguisher can now be applied to targets similarly to spray bottles and the chemical sprayer."
  - tweak: "Slimes now take damage from having water splashed on them, instead of just from fire extinguishers."
  - tweak: "Increased the effectiveness of chemical foam. Foams no longer apply less reagents the more foam you use and increased the amount of reagents added with low quantities of reagents."
  - bugfix: "Fixed a bug where Strained Muscles could toggle godmode among other effects due to it removing bitflags incorrectly."
