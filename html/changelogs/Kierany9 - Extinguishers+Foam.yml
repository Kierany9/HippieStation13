changes: 
  - tweak: "Water's effectiveness at extinguishing fire has been doubled and extinguishers now carry 100u instead of 50u so that they're less awful."
  - tweak: "Fire extinguishers now use VAPOR instead of TOUCH. This means that reagents inside the extinguisher can now be applied to targets similarly to spray bottles and the chemical sprayer."
  - tweak: "Slimes now take damage from having water splashed on them, instead of just from fire extinguishers."
  - tweak: "Increased the effectiveness of chemical foam. Foams no longer apply less reagents the more foam you use and increased the amount of reagents added with low quantities of reagents."
  - tweak: "Buffed Beepsky Smash. The stun effect now works exactly like Neurotoxin except that it doesn't kick in until 5 ticks have passed."
  - tweak: "Both Neurotoxin and Beepsky Smash now require at least 3 units to stun."
  - bugfix: "Fixed a bug where Strained Muscles could toggle godmode among other effects due to it removing bitflags incorrectly."
